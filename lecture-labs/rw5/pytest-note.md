Today we just have start to learn code in python and test the program, The initial start was not smooth, because I have a windows computer.
After some setting up and change some commond code, I have made it work. 
Then I start doing the testing code and try to understand how python work.
The time during the class is a little tight, so I have to start some basic pyton learning.
